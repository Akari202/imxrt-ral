# imxrt-ral examples

The examples in this directory run on hardware. They demonstrate basic features
of the imxrt-ral. See each directory's documentation for build and flashing
instructions.

If you're looking for a higher-level API, consider using the [`imxrt-hal`]
hardware abstraction layer for i.MX RT processors.
